# IMEXjs
IMEX (pronounced im-ex) is a code modularization library that provides elegant and easy ways to share and reuse codes from different files or scripts in a web application or even other web applications.    

IMEXjs is simple. Write your code in modular form like you would when writing nodejs applications. This avoids code re-writing and allows for code reusability. Also, thinnk of a component based application which may have over 1000 separate files that make up the entire code base of an app. Would you bundle all files together and serve them at once? I guess no. The best approach is to serve only files or scripts neccessary to get the app running at a pareticular moment. IMEX makes this easy.    

IMEXjs brings into you application what is known as a package manager. It takes care of loading your modules and managing dependencies.
